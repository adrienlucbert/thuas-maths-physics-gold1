# 3D Cube

This is the first gold achievements for the Maths & Physics class in THUAS'
Game Development & Simulation minor.

## Instructions

Create a 3D cube that can rotate around all axis (x, y, z) and translate in all
directions (x, y, z), without using the built-in rotation or vector
functionality of Unity.  
This can be done by:
- using the mouse: with each change the corresponding transformation matrix is
determined and displayed
- manually changing the transformation matrix

### Result

*Work in progress*

## Credits

This project is the work of [Adrien Lucbert](https://github.com/adrienlucbert),
and the Maths & Physics class was given by Rick Appleton.
